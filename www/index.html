	      The Project Snowman application is a capture the flag game built on top of the
	      <a href="http://www.projectdarkstar.com">Project Darkstar</a> stack.  Each team
	      is a team of snowmen armed with snowballs to prevent the other team from capturing
	      their flag.  It is a networked, multiplayer game intended to showcase Project Darkstar's
	      capabilities as well as provide a launching point for other game developers interested in
	      what a Project Darkstar based game might look like.
